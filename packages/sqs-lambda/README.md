## Installation

To install this package, run the following command:

```bash
npm install @treedom/cdk-constructs-sqs-lambda
```

## API Reference

### EventBridgeSqsLambda

The main construct provided by this package.

#### Constructor

```typescript
new EventBridgeSqsLambda(scope: Construct, id: string, props: EventBridgeSqsLambdaProps)
```
## Usage

This package provides the `EventBridgeSqsLambda` construct, which sets up an integration between EventBridge, SQS, and Lambda.

Here's a basic example of how to use the construct:

```typescript
import { EventBridgeSqsLambda } from '@treedom/cdk-constructs-sqs-lambda';
import { Stack } from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';

class MyStack extends Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string) {
    super(scope, id);

    new EventBridgeSqsLambda(this, 'MyEventBridgeSqsLambda', {
      envPrefix: 'myapp',
      ruleProps: {
        eventBus: myEventBus,
        eventPattern: {
          // Define your event pattern here
        },
      },
      nodejsFunctionProps: {
        // Define your Lambda function properties here
      },
    });
  }
}
```

#### Properties

- `deadLetterQueue`: The dead-letter queue for the SQS queue.
- `readQueue`: The main SQS queue.
- `eventSource`: The SQS event source for the Lambda function.
- `rules`: An array of EventBridge rules.
- `lambda`: The NodeJS Lambda function.
- `envPrefix`: The environment prefix used for naming resources.

#### Methods

- `addRule(ruleName: string, ruleProps: EventBridgeSqsLambdaRuleProps)`: Adds a new EventBridge rule to the construct.

#### EventBridgeSqsLambdaProps

The `EventBridgeSqsLambdaProps` interface includes the following properties:

- `queue`: (Optional) Properties for the main SQS queue, including an optional `retryAttempts` number.
- `queueDlq`: (Optional) Properties for the dead-letter queue.
- `rules`: (Optional) Array of EventBridge rules configuration.
- `lambda`: (Optional) Properties for the NodeJS Lambda function.
- `eventSource`: (Optional) Properties for the SQS event source.
- `namesPrefix`: (Optional) A string used as a prefix for naming resources.

### LambdaMaxScalingAspect

This class implements the `IAspect` interface and can be used to verify if some lambdas exceed the maximum allowed concurrency. Default maximum concurrency is 10 if not specified. maximum scaling specified. If the limit is exceeded an error Annotation on the lambda will be emitted.

#### Usage

```typescript
import { LambdaMaxScalingAspect } from '@treedom/cdk-constructs-sqs-lambda';

const maxScalingAspect = new LambdaMaxScalingAspect({maximumConcurrency: 50})

Aspects.of(this).add(maxScalingAspect);

```
