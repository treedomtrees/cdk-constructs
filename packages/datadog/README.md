```typescript
import { Aspects } from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { AddDatadogToLambdasAspect } from '@treedom/cdk-constructs-datadog';
import { DatadogLambda } from 'datadog-cdk-constructs-v2';

// Create a DatadogLambda instance
const datadogLambda = new DatadogLambda(this, 'DatadogLambda', {
  // Configure your Datadog Lambda as needed
    site: "datadoghq.eu",
    apiKeySecretArn: "arn:my-arn",
    env: "test",
    nodeLayerVersion: 115,
    extensionLayerVersion: 65,
    captureLambdaPayload: true,
    sourceCodeIntegration: true,
    logLevel: "warn",
    service: "my-service",
    redirectHandler: false,<>
});

// Create the AddDatadogToLambdas aspect
const datadogAspect = new AddDatadogToLambdasAspect({
  datadog: datadogLambda,
  extensionVersion: "next" 
});

// Apply the aspect to your stack
Aspects.of(this).add(datadogAspect);
